<p>Dear recruiting team,</p>

<p>I am excited to apply for the Android Developer position at your company. My experience for the last 10+ years involves the development of Android applications and SDKs.
Some of development involved heavy parallelization and high performance work. During my time in companies such as Bosch and Leica Geosystems I had oportunity to work
on cutting edge technology (3D scanners software, Car industry SDKs, and many others) and to deliver stable builds and important quality improvements.</p>

<p>So far I have successfully led the development of over several Android products, ranging from consumer-facing to the enterprise-level solutions. 
One such was at my last position in Harness (Enterprise-Size software development), where I worked on the development of mobile SDKs for company’s Feature Flag division.</p>

<p>Some highlights of my qualifications include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technical Expertise</strong>: Proficient in Java, Kotlin, Android SDK, RESTful APIs, and modern development tools (using Kotlin Coroutines, MVVM, JetPack Compose, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>User-Centric Design</strong>: Skilled in collaborating with UX/UI designers to create intuitive, visually appealing interfaces that enhance user satisfaction and retention</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, reducing app load times. Always looking for the new improvements and ways to achieve best possible performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Leadership &amp; Mentorship</strong>: I had experience in leading the teams, but also worked separately and independently as well. I was conducting the code review on regular basis. I am always ready and happy to share knowledge, experience and ideas with other team members!</li>
</ul>

<p>I would be thankful for the opportunity to discuss with you how my skills and experience align with your team’s needs.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your continued success.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
Milos Vasic</p>
