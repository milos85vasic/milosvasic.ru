# Milos Vasic, cover letter

Dear recruiting team,

I am excited to apply for the Android Developer position at your company. My experience for the last 10+ years involves the development of Android applications and SDKs.
Some of development involved heavy parallelization and high performance work. During my time in companies such as Bosch and Leica Geosystems I had oportunity to work
on cutting edge technology (3D scanners software, Car industry SDKs, and many others) and to deliver stable builds and important quality improvements.

So far I have successfully led the development of over several Android products, ranging from consumer-facing to the enterprise-level solutions. 
One such was at my last position in Harness (Enterprise-Size software development), where I worked on the development of mobile SDKs for company's Feature Flag division. 

Some highlights of my qualifications include:

- **Technical Expertise**: Proficient in Java, Kotlin, Android SDK, RESTful APIs, and modern development tools (using Kotlin Coroutines, MVVM, JetPack Compose, etc.)
- **User-Centric Design**: Skilled in collaborating with UX/UI designers to create intuitive, visually appealing interfaces that enhance user satisfaction and retention
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, reducing app load times. Always looking for the new improvements and ways to achieve best possible performance.
- **Leadership & Mentorship**: I had experience in leading the teams, but also worked separately and independently as well. I was conducting the code review on regular basis. I am always ready and happy to share knowledge, experience and ideas with other team members!

I would be thankful for the opportunity to discuss with you how my skills and experience align with your teamâ€™s needs.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your continued success.

Sincerely,  
Milos Vasic
